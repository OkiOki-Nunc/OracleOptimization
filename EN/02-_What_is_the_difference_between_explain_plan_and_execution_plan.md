The terms "Explain Plan" and "Execution Plan" are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings in the context of SQL query optimization:

Explain Plan: An Explain Plan is a representation of the optimizer's chosen execution plan for a SQL query. It displays the operations that the optimizer has determined are the most efficient way to retrieve the data, based on the available statistics and other factors. The Explain Plan is a diagnostic tool that helps you understand how the query will be executed and identify potential performance bottlenecks. You can generate an Explain Plan using the EXPLAIN PLAN statement, the DBMS_XPLAN package, or SQL*Plus AUTOTRACE feature, among other methods.

Execution Plan: The Execution Plan is the actual series of steps the database engine follows to execute a SQL query. While the Explain Plan is an estimation of the Execution Plan, the actual Execution Plan might differ slightly due to runtime factors such as data distribution, available resources, and other dynamic conditions. The Execution Plan is generated by the Oracle Optimizer during the query optimization process and is then executed by the database engine.

In summary, the Explain Plan is a human-readable representation of the optimizer's estimated Execution Plan for a SQL query. It helps you understand how the query will be executed and diagnose potential performance issues. The Execution Plan, on the other hand, is the actual series of steps taken by the database engine to execute the query.
