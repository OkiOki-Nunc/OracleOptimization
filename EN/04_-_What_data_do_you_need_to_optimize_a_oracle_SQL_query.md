To optimize an Oracle SQL query, you need to gather relevant data to identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Here is a list of data and information that you should consider collecting:
___
Query text: Obtain the exact SQL query text that you want to optimize.
___
Execution plan: Use Oracle's EXPLAIN PLAN statement or the DBMS_XPLAN package to generate and analyze the query's execution plan. This will provide you with information on how the Oracle optimizer plans to execute the query, including the join methods, access paths, and estimated costs.
___
Table and index statistics: Gather statistics on tables and indexes involved in the query using the DBMS_STATS package. Accurate statistics help the Oracle optimizer to make better decisions when creating the execution plan.
___
System statistics: Obtain system-level statistics, such as CPU and I/O performance, using the DBMS_STATS package. This helps the optimizer understand the system's capabilities and limitations when optimizing the query.
___
Initialization parameters: Review the relevant Oracle initialization parameters that can influence query optimization, such as OPTIMIZER_MODE, OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING, and OPTIMIZER_INDEX_COST_ADJ.
___
SQL trace and wait events: Collect SQL trace data using the DBMS_MONITOR package or by enabling the 10046 event. This can help you identify wait events and other bottlenecks in the query execution.
___
Oracle AWR and ASH reports: Review Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Active Session History (ASH) reports to gain insight into overall database performance and identify recurring performance issues.
___
Index and constraint information: Examine the indexes and constraints on the tables involved in the query to identify any missing or inefficient indexes.
___
Data distribution: Understand the data distribution and skew within the tables and columns involved in the query. This can help identify performance issues related to data skew and guide optimization efforts.
___
Application context: Understand the context of the query within the application to determine the query's importance, frequency of execution, and potential impact on other parts of the system.
___
Once you have gathered this information, you can use it to identify areas of improvement and implement changes, such as rewriting the SQL query, adding or modifying indexes, adjusting optimizer parameters, or using hints to guide the optimizer's decision-making.
